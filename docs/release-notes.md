## 1.5.0
Released 23 August 2024.

### For players:
* Nickel is now able to load legacy mods from ZIP files (by first extracting them to a temporary folder). This is done every time Nickel starts, so if you want to avoid some extra load times, it is still recommended to extract mods manually.

* Fixed the Logbook replacement not showing a lot of the combo data.

* Plugin (mod) package paths are now case insensitive, no matter the underlying filesystem or storage method.
* `IAssemblyDefinitionEditor.EditAssemblyDefinition` now needs to return a `bool` reflecting whether the editor actually edited the assembly, and also gets a new parameter which lets an editor log messages.
* Incorporated a new [Mitosis](https://github.com/Nanoray-pl/Mitosis) library and replaced `Mutil.DeepCopy`'s implementation with one utilizing Mitosis, significantly improving copying performance.
* Updated the Pintail library, which changes how enums are proxied, improving performance and allowing flag enums to be used.

## 1.4.0
Released 1 August 2024.

### For players:
* Nickel now loads its pre-installed mods from the `InternalModLibrary` folder. These mods take priority over any duplicates found in the `ModLibrary` folder.
* The Logbook got replaced with a less pretty, but at least usable alternative.
* The tooltip scrolling feature will now only lock up other UI scrolling if the tooltip does not fit at once on screen.
* Replaced character/ship scroll buttons with properly shaded ones.
* The game will no longer crash when trying to display a run summary containing a ship or characters that are not currently loaded.

* General optimizations.

### For developers:
* `Artifact.ReplaceSpawnedThing` is now hookable.
* Added `ModUtilities.Harmony`, `ModUtilities.DelayedHarmony` and `ModUtilities.ApplyDelayedHarmonyPatches()`. Using `DelayedHarmony` should be preferred if possible - it improves patching performance the more mods use it.

## 1.1.0
Released 14 July 2024.

### For players:
* `Nickel.UpdateChecks` now advertises itself as just "Nickel" whenever there is an update.
* Updated the Pintail library, fixing a problem with some mods not working if Debug was disabled (the default).

### For developers:
* Added `StatusConfiguration.ShouldFlash`.
* Mods can now access the `IProxyManager` used by Nickel for proxying purposes via `IModUtilities.ProxyManager`.
* Updated the Pintail library. It now validates whether a type can be proxied before defining a proxy type, preventing an exception being thrown when `GetTypes()` was called on the assembly containing the proxy types.

* Fixed a mod setting visual issue on the Profile setting submenu.

## 1.0.0

* Improved mod load times.
* Added `Nickel.ModSettings`, creating a common interface for all mods to add their settings to.

* The Memories menu now highlights the arrow buttons if you have any unlocked but not yet seen memories scrolled away.
* Mod descriptions now also show up for enemy characters (as long as they are added by the Nickel API).
* Nickel now ignores mods in ZIP files, if they also exist extracted.
* Nickel now sanitizes any file system paths it logs, by replacing full user home paths with just `~`.

* Added additional APIs for obtaining new collision-free enum case values.

* Added `AwaitApi` and `AwaitApiOrNull` methods, which wait until a mod is loaded before returning the API (unlike `GetApi`).
* Split `IModCards.OnGetVolatileCardTraitOverrides` into `OnGetDynamicInnateCardTraitOverrides` and `OnGetFinalDynamicCardTraitOverrides`. These can now also affect vanilla card traits.
* Actually implemented part-type-exclusive artifacts (these used to do nothing).

## 0.11.0
Released 11 May 2024.

* Added additional indicators for the current pile the card is in when browsing cards with `CardBrowse`.

* Fixed EXE blacklist checkbox appearing on run summary if CAT is currently selected for a new run.
* Fixed Codex filter buttons using `Spr` directly, breaking on various game versions.

## 0.8.1

* Fixed some `IFileInfo`/`IDirectoryInfo` path relativity issues.

## 0.4.3
Released 22 January 2024.

* Various bugfixes.

### `ModBuildConfig`
