## 0.11.0
Released 11 May 2024.

## 0.6.0
Released 3 February 2024.

* Fixed some `IFileInfo`/`IDirectoryInfo` path relativity issues.

## 0.5.0

## 0.4.3
Released 22 January 2024.

* Added an experimental legacy mod change, calling `BootMod` during `Mod` instance construction. This should allow using mod APIs properly when the dependencies are set correctly, but has the potential to break if mods didn't use `GetApi` right.

* Added a LOT more logs.
* Various bugfixes.

### `ModBuildConfig`
