# Release notes

## Upcoming release

### For developers:
* Added `IsShowingShips` and `PreviewingShip` APIs to `Nickel.Essentials`.
* Added `EnglishFallbackLocalizationProvider` and `MissingPlaceholderNonBoundLocalizationProvider` implementations.
* Fixed `JsonLocalizationProvider` returning comments as strings.

## 1.3.0
Released 24 July 2024.

### For players:
* Added a new ship selector to the new run screen.
* Long tooltips are now scrollable with a mouse scroll wheel or the controller right thumbstick.
* Fixed complex card trait situations resulting in wrong states (fixes Natasha's Dark Web Data artifact).
* The game will no longer crash when trying to display a run summary containing cards or artifacts that are not currently loaded.

## 1.2.1
Released 18 July 2024.

### For players:
* Toned down on one optimization, fixing a crash when playing any card with specific mods installed together.

## 1.2.0
Released 17 July 2024.

### For players:
* Updated for Cobalt Core 1.1.2.
* General optimizations.

### For developers:
* `Artifact.ReplaceSpawnedThing` is now hookable.
* Added `ModUtilities.Harmony`, `ModUtilities.DelayedHarmony` and `ModUtilities.ApplyDelayedHarmonyPatches()`. Using `DelayedHarmony` should be preferred if possible - it improves patching performance the more mods use it.

## 1.1.0
Released 14 July 2024.

* Mods can now access the `IProxyManager` used by Nickel for proxying purposes via `IModUtilities.ProxyManager`.
* Updated the Pintail library. It now validates whether a type can be proxied before defining a proxy type, preventing an exception being thrown when `GetTypes()` was called on the assembly containing the proxy types.

### For developers:
* [[#92](https://github.com/Shockah/Nickel/issues/92)] Fixed artifact hooks losing access to captured variables, seemingly accessing garbage memory.

## 1.0.0
Released 3 July 2024.

### For players:
* The pre-installed `Essentials` mod is now renamed to `Nickel.Essentials`. **Be sure to remove the old `Essentials` folder when updating Nickel.**
* Changed the default path where mod saves are stored from the Nickel's folder to the user's application data folder (`%AppData%\CobaltCore\Nickel\Saves`). **You will have to re-import your save files, or move the files manually.**
* Nickel now lets you resize its window.
* Improved mod load times.
* Added `Nickel.ModSettings`, creating a common interface for all mods to add their settings to.
* Added various settings for all Nickel modules.
* Update checks now remind you to set them up properly, and when your API key / token gets revoked or expires.
* Update checks now happen much earlier and even for mods which failed to load.
* The game no longer proposes memories which don't exist (for modded characters).
* The Memories menu now highlights the arrow buttons if you have any unlocked but not yet seen memories scrolled away.
* Mod descriptions now also show up for enemy characters (as long as they are added by the Nickel API).
* Nickel now ignores mods in ZIP files, if they also exist extracted.
* Nickel now sanitizes any file system paths it logs, by replacing full user home paths with just `~`.
* Nickel now has a different error log message when a mod cannot be loaded due to a missing dependency at a specific version (as compared to missing altogether).
* Fixed Nickel crashing when starting the game in a non-English language or when switching to one.
* Fixed starter deck preview sometimes showing up an extra Basic Shot on Normal difficulty, even though Hard+ was selected.
* Fixed card Codex deck filters sometimes not being properly scrollable, and weirdly jumping visually.
* Fixed controller support for the Save Import menu.

### For developers:
* Nickel now has full XML documentation for all public members.
* Added APIs for storing mod settings in a common place.
* Added APIs for copying all mod data from one object to another.
* Added APIs for registering non-playable characters (enemies or story characters).
* Added an API to register dynamic sprites.
* Added a way for mods to get a list of all resolved mods (including ones which may not have been loaded, for various reasons).
* Added additional APIs for obtaining new collision-free enum case values.
* Added an event mods can subscribe to to get informed about the game closing, either normally or via an exception being thrown.
* Added `AwaitApi` and `AwaitApiOrNull` methods, which wait until a mod is loaded before returning the API (unlike `GetApi`).
* Split `IModCards.OnGetVolatileCardTraitOverrides` into `OnGetDynamicInnateCardTraitOverrides` and `OnGetFinalDynamicCardTraitOverrides`. These can now also affect vanilla card traits.
* Actually implemented part-type-exclusive artifacts (these used to do nothing).
* `[ModBuildConfig 1.0.0]` Legacy mods can now use .NET 8 and interact with Nickel directly via a new `INickelManifest` interface.

## 0.12.0
Released 15 May 2024.

* Added update checks for installed mods.
* Fixed `Nickel.Legacy` not generating `nickel.json` files for mods after the latest changes.

Released 13 May 2024.

* Additional improvements to the save recovering mechanism.

## 0.11.0
Released 11 May 2024.

* Added an option to import vanilla saves into Nickel straight from the Profile Select menu.
* Added additional indicators for the current pile the card is in when browsing cards with `CardBrowse`.
* Added enemy support for mods.

* Fixed EXE blacklist checkbox appearing on run summary if CAT is currently selected for a new run.
* Fixed Codex filter buttons using `Spr` directly, breaking on various game versions.

## 0.8.1
Released 14 April 2024.

Released 14 April 2024.

Released 10 February 2024.

* Added `Nickel::OnAfterGameAssemblyPhaseFinished` and `Nickel::OnAfterDbInitPhaseFinished` events for legacy mods' event hubs.

Released 8 February 2024.

* Added a `--vanilla` commandline flag, mostly for Thunderstore integration.

## 0.6.0
Released 3 February 2024.

* Essentials: General card codex filtering improvements (including performance).
* Fixed some `IFileInfo`/`IDirectoryInfo` path relativity issues.

## 0.5.0
Released 27 January 2024.

## 0.4.3
Released 22 January 2024.

* Added an experimental legacy mod change, calling `BootMod` during `Mod` instance construction. This should allow using mod APIs properly when the dependencies are set correctly, but has the potential to break if mods didn't use `GetApi` right.

* Added a LOT more logs.
* Various bugfixes.

### `ModBuildConfig`
`Nickel.ModBuildConfig` is also updated to 0.4.0.
