* Added support for custom card traits.

Released 8 February 2024.

* Added a `--vanilla` commandline flag, mostly for Thunderstore integration.

## 0.6.0
Released 3 February 2024.

* Nickel is now high-DPI aware - it should scale the same way vanilla does. Keep in mind this can make the debug menu very tiny on high resolution screens. If needed, this can be addressed in a future update.

* Essentials: General card codex filtering improvements (including performance).
* Fixed some `IFileInfo`/`IDirectoryInfo` path relativity issues.

## 0.5.0
Released 27 January 2024.

## 0.4.3
Released 22 January 2024.

* Added an experimental legacy mod change, calling `BootMod` during `Mod` instance construction. This should allow using mod APIs properly when the dependencies are set correctly, but has the potential to break if mods didn't use `GetApi` right.

* Initializing Steam even in debug mode.
* Essentials: Controller support for crew selection.
* Essentials: Memories screen is now scrollable, and also supports controllers.
* Cards and artifacts no longer register themselves as their `Type.Name`, so they can no longer conflict. This however means that codexes will have to be filled in again.

* Added a LOT more logs.
